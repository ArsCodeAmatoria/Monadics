# Bayesian Collapse in Quantum Monadics

In traditional quantum computing, collapse is treated as a final, probabilistic event: a measurement causes a superposed state to resolve into a definite one. But in Monadics—a quantum-aware computational paradigm—we take collapse seriously as a computational operation, not just a side effect.

This post introduces Bayesian collapse as a fundamental extension to quantum computation using Qiskit, exploring how inference, not randomness, can govern the evolution and selection of quantum states. This forms a crucial part of Monadics, where monadic structure is fused with quantum behavior to simulate inference, feedback, and conscious computation.

## Quantum Computation: A Brief Primer

Quantum computers operate on qubits, which exist in linear superpositions:

$$|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle, \quad |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$$

The computation proceeds via unitary gates (e.g., Hadamard, CNOT), transforming the quantum state. Eventually, a measurement collapses the state, selecting a classical outcome based on the probability amplitudes:

$$P(0) = |\alpha|^2, \quad P(1) = |\beta|^2$$

This traditional collapse is irreversible and is usually deferred to the end of a quantum circuit.

### Quantum State Evolution

<ContentCard title="Basic Quantum Circuit with Measurement">
```
|0⟩ ──[H]──●──[M]── Classical Bit
           │
    Superposition
    |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩

Time: t=0    t=1    t=2
State: |0⟩ → |+⟩ → |0⟩ or |1⟩
```

Where `[H]` is Hadamard gate, `●` represents superposition state, and `[M]` is measurement.

## Mid-Circuit Collapse

Modern quantum programming tools like Qiskit allow mid-circuit measurement, enabling the system to:

- **Observe and collapse** part of the quantum state mid-execution
- **Use classical logic** (if conditions) to control subsequent operations

Example:

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 1)
qc.h(0)
qc.measure(0, 0)
qc.x(1).c_if(0, 1)  # Apply X gate on qubit 1 if qubit 0 collapses to 1
```

This introduces a primitive form of feedback. However, it is still rooted in random collapse.

### Mid-Circuit Measurement Flow

                         │
              Classical Control
              if c0 == 1

Circuit Evolution:
|00⟩ → 1/√2(|00⟩ + |10⟩) → Measurement → {|00⟩ (50%) or |11⟩ (50%)}

## From Randomness to Inference: Bayesian Collapse

In Monadics, collapse is not mere randomness—it is **inference**. We introduce Bayesian reasoning into the collapse process, allowing the system to prefer certain outcomes based on prior beliefs.

Given a superposed state:

$$|\psi\rangle = \sum_{\omega \in \Omega} \alpha_\omega |\omega\rangle$$

We reinterpret the amplitude squared, \(|\alpha_\omega|^2\), as the likelihood of outcome \(\omega\). We then combine this with a prior distribution over the possible outcomes to compute a posterior via Bayes' Rule:

$$P(\omega|D) = \frac{P(D|\omega) \cdot P(\omega)}{\sum_{\omega'} P(D|\omega') \cdot P(\omega')}$$

Where:
- \(P(\omega)\) is the prior belief about outcome \(\omega\)
- \(P(D|\omega)\) is the likelihood (based on quantum amplitudes)
- \(P(\omega|D)\) is the posterior—how much we believe \(\omega\) is the correct collapse, given the data

We then sample from the posterior, not the raw quantum amplitudes.

### Bayesian Collapse Process

<ContentCard title="Bayesian-Weighted Quantum Measurement Circuit">
```
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ ──●──[B]──[M*]─── Bayesian Outcome
                     │   │    │
     Amplitudes: ───[A]──┘    │
     |α|², |β|²              │
                             │
     Prior P(ω): ────────────┴─ Informed Collapse
     
Bayesian Transform [B]:
Raw: P(ω) = |α_ω|²
          ↓ (Bayes Rule)
Posterior: P(ω|D) = P(D|ω)·P(ω) / ΣP(D|ω')·P(ω')

Measurement [M*]: Sample from posterior instead of |ψ|²
```

Bayesian measurement replaces Born rule with informed probabilistic collapse.

## Qiskit Implementation

Here's how Bayesian collapse is implemented in Qiskit:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
import random

# Step 1: Simulate state
qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
qc.h(0)  # Create superposition
backend = Aer.get_backend('statevector_simulator')
result = execute(qc, backend).result()
statevector = result.get_statevector()
likelihoods = [abs(amplitude)**2 for amplitude in statevector]

# Step 2: Define prior
prior = [0.9, 0.1]  # Example: strongly believe in |0⟩

# Step 3: Compute posterior
evidence = sum(l * p for l, p in zip(likelihoods, prior))
posterior = [(l * p) / evidence for l, p in zip(likelihoods, prior)]

# Step 4: Sample collapse outcome
collapsed_state = random.choices([0, 1], weights=posterior)[0]
```

This turns collapse into a belief-weighted decision, modeling inference and even attention bias.

## Monadics: Bayesian Collapse as Monadic Bind

We can model Bayesian collapse in Haskell using monadic structure. Consider this:

```haskell
data QState a = Superposed [(a, Complex Double)]  -- Superposed state
              | Collapsed a                       -- After collapse

collapseBayesian :: QState a -> (a -> QState b) -> (a -> Double) -> QState b
collapseBayesian (Superposed amps) f prior =
  let likelihoods = map (\(_, amp) -> magnitude amp ** 2) amps
      states      = map fst amps
      priors      = map prior states
      evidence    = sum $ zipWith (*) likelihoods priors
      posterior   = zipWith (\l p -> (l * p) / evidence) likelihoods priors
      chosen      = sampleFromDistribution states posterior
  in f chosen
```

This `collapseBayesian` function behaves as a Bayesian monadic bind, weighting future computation by informed collapse.

### Monadic Collapse Chain

<ContentCard title="Haskell Monad Circuit for Quantum Collapse">
```
QState a ──>>= collapseBayesian ──>>= f ──>> QState b
   │                │                │         │
   ●               [P]              [→]        ●
Superposed     Prior Func      Continuation  Result
   
Type Signature:
collapseBayesian :: QState a -> (a -> QState b) -> (a -> Double) -> QState b

Monadic Bind Chain:
do state ← superposed
   prior ← getPrior
   collapsed ← bayesianCollapse state prior
   result ← continuation collapsed
   return result

Where: >>= is monadic bind, [P] applies priors, [→] is continuation
```

Monadic composition chains probabilistic quantum operations with type safety.

## Collapse as Reasoning

In Monadics, collapse is computation. With Bayesian reasoning added:

- **Collapse selects outcomes** based on prior knowledge
- **Circuits can adapt** mid-execution, simulating intelligent inference
- **Collapse becomes controlled resolution** of superposition, not a passive measurement

This approach aligns collapse with decision-making, control, and consciousness.

### Conscious Collapse Architecture

<ContentCard title="Consciousness Circuit with Quantum-Classical Feedback">
```
|ψₙ⟩ ──[U]──●──[B]──[M*]───┬─── Decision
            │   ↑           │
            │   │           │
     [Memory]   [P]         │ Classical
            │   ↑           │ Feedback
            │   │           │
            └───┴───[Update]┘
                    ↑
               Observation
               History

Consciousness Loop:
1. [U]: Unitary evolution (thought formation)
2. [B]: Bayesian weighting with priors [P]
3. [M*]: Informed measurement/collapse
4. [Update]: Classical decision updates memory
5. [Memory]: Feeds back to priors for next cycle

Time Evolution: |ψₙ⟩ → Decision → |ψₙ₊₁⟩ → ...
```

Each conscious moment emerges from quantum-classical feedback between belief and collapse.

## Summary

We have extended Monadics with a Bayesian model of collapse, replacing randomness with inference. Using Qiskit, we demonstrate how mid-circuit measurement can be modified to reflect posterior-weighted decisions.

This allows us to treat quantum computation not merely as a system of gates and probabilities, but as a compositional reasoning system—a step closer to artificial consciousness.

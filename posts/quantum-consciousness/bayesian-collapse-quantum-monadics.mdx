# Bayesian Collapse in Quantum Monadics

In traditional quantum computing, collapse is treated as a final, probabilistic event: a measurement causes a superposed state to resolve into a definite one. But in Monadics—a quantum-aware computational paradigm—we take collapse seriously as a computational operation, not just a side effect.

This post introduces Bayesian collapse as a fundamental extension to quantum computation using Qiskit, exploring how inference, not randomness, can govern the evolution and selection of quantum states. This forms a crucial part of Monadics, where monadic structure is fused with quantum behavior to simulate inference, feedback, and conscious computation.

## Quantum Computation: A Brief Primer

Quantum computers operate on qubits, which exist in linear superpositions:

$$|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle, \quad |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$$

The computation proceeds via unitary gates (e.g., Hadamard, CNOT), transforming the quantum state. Eventually, a measurement collapses the state, selecting a classical outcome based on the probability amplitudes:

$$P(0) = |\alpha|^2, \quad P(1) = |\beta|^2$$

This traditional collapse is irreversible and is usually deferred to the end of a quantum circuit.

## Mid-Circuit Collapse

Modern quantum programming tools like Qiskit allow mid-circuit measurement, enabling the system to:

- **Observe and collapse** part of the quantum state mid-execution
- **Use classical logic** (if conditions) to control subsequent operations

Example:

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 1)
qc.h(0)
qc.measure(0, 0)
qc.x(1).c_if(0, 1)  # Apply X gate on qubit 1 if qubit 0 collapses to 1
```

This introduces a primitive form of feedback. However, it is still rooted in random collapse.

## From Randomness to Inference: Bayesian Collapse

In Monadics, collapse is not mere randomness—it is **inference**. We introduce Bayesian reasoning into the collapse process, allowing the system to prefer certain outcomes based on prior beliefs.

Given a superposed state:

$$|\psi\rangle = \sum_{\omega \in \Omega} \alpha_\omega |\omega\rangle$$

We reinterpret the amplitude squared, \(|\alpha_\omega|^2\), as the likelihood of outcome \(\omega\). We then combine this with a prior distribution over the possible outcomes to compute a posterior via Bayes' Rule:

$$P(\omega|D) = \frac{P(D|\omega) \cdot P(\omega)}{\sum_{\omega'} P(D|\omega') \cdot P(\omega')}$$

Where:
- \(P(\omega)\) is the prior belief about outcome \(\omega\)
- \(P(D|\omega)\) is the likelihood (based on quantum amplitudes)
- \(P(\omega|D)\) is the posterior—how much we believe \(\omega\) is the correct collapse, given the data

We then sample from the posterior, not the raw quantum amplitudes.

## Qiskit Implementation

Here's how Bayesian collapse is implemented in Qiskit:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
import random

# Step 1: Simulate state
qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
qc.h(0)  # Create superposition
backend = Aer.get_backend('statevector_simulator')
result = execute(qc, backend).result()
statevector = result.get_statevector()
likelihoods = [abs(amplitude)**2 for amplitude in statevector]

# Step 2: Define prior
prior = [0.9, 0.1]  # Example: strongly believe in |0⟩

# Step 3: Compute posterior
evidence = sum(l * p for l, p in zip(likelihoods, prior))
posterior = [(l * p) / evidence for l, p in zip(likelihoods, prior)]

# Step 4: Sample collapse outcome
collapsed_state = random.choices([0, 1], weights=posterior)[0]
```

This turns collapse into a belief-weighted decision, modeling inference and even attention bias.

## Monadics: Bayesian Collapse as Monadic Bind

We can model Bayesian collapse in Haskell using monadic structure. Consider this:

```haskell
data QState a = Superposed [(a, Complex Double)]  -- Superposed state
              | Collapsed a                       -- After collapse

collapseBayesian :: QState a -> (a -> QState b) -> (a -> Double) -> QState b
collapseBayesian (Superposed amps) f prior =
  let likelihoods = map (\(_, amp) -> magnitude amp ** 2) amps
      states      = map fst amps
      priors      = map prior states
      evidence    = sum $ zipWith (*) likelihoods priors
      posterior   = zipWith (\l p -> (l * p) / evidence) likelihoods priors
      chosen      = sampleFromDistribution states posterior
  in f chosen
```

This `collapseBayesian` function behaves as a Bayesian monadic bind, weighting future computation by informed collapse.

## Collapse as Reasoning

In Monadics, collapse is computation. With Bayesian reasoning added:

- **Collapse selects outcomes** based on prior knowledge
- **Circuits can adapt** mid-execution, simulating intelligent inference
- **Collapse becomes controlled resolution** of superposition, not a passive measurement

This approach aligns collapse with decision-making, control, and consciousness.

## Summary

We have extended Monadics with a Bayesian model of collapse, replacing randomness with inference. Using Qiskit, we demonstrate how mid-circuit measurement can be modified to reflect posterior-weighted decisions.

This allows us to treat quantum computation not merely as a system of gates and probabilities, but as a compositional reasoning system—a step closer to artificial consciousness.

# Collapse Tubule Automaton: Toward a Conscious Quantum Framework

## Abstract

The Collapse Tubule Automaton (CTA) is a novel computational model designed to simulate irreversible, conscious-like computation. Inspired by microtubules, quantum measurement, and monadic collapse logic, the CTA fuses directional graph growth with collapse-reward dynamics. This article introduces the CTA and explores how it can be integrated with quantum circuits to form a hybrid conscious computation system — bridging classical collapse logic with probabilistic quantum evolution.

## 1. Introduction

Conventional computation treats time and choice as reversible or atemporal: decisions can be backtracked, states can be reverted, and functions are pure. But conscious experience appears irreversible, stateful, and path-dependent.

The Collapse Tubule Automaton introduces a model of computation where **decisions are final**, and structure grows around those decisions, forming a tubular graph — a synthetic consciousness mechanism.

## 2. What Is a Collapse Tubule Automaton?

A CTA is a growing, directed graph embedded in a **tubular topology**. Computation is modeled by **collapse events**, where one path is selected and others are pruned irreversibly. Each collapse is both a decision and an evolutionary step. This structure supports:

- **Directional growth**
- **Topological constraints**
- **Reward-guided learning**
- **Entangled path awareness**
- **Temporal irreversibility**

## 3. Collapse-Reward Trees

A **Collapse-Reward Tree (CRT)** is a structure where:

- Each branch represents a potential computation path
- Only one path is collapsed and executed  
- The result is evaluated and assigned a reward
- Future collapses are biased by prior rewards

This allows **learning without backpropagation**, similar to how real-world agents adapt via experience.

### Formal Structure

$$\text{collapse}(n) := \arg\max_{a \in A(n)} \phi(n,a)$$

Where $\phi$ evaluates action quality using past reward traces.

```haskell
-- Collapse-Reward Tree implementation
data CollapseNode a = CollapseNode
  { nodeValue :: a
  , branches :: [CollapseNode a]
  , reward :: Double
  , collapseWeight :: Double
  } deriving (Show)

-- Collapse function with reward bias
collapse :: CollapseNode a -> IO (CollapseNode a)
collapse node = do
  let weights = map collapseWeight (branches node)
  let totalWeight = sum weights
  randomVal <- randomRIO (0, totalWeight)
  let selectedBranch = selectByWeight randomVal weights (branches node)
  return selectedBranch
  where
    selectByWeight _ _ [] = error "No branches to select"
    selectByWeight val (w:ws) (b:bs)
      | val <= w = b
      | otherwise = selectByWeight (val - w) ws bs
```

Collapse-reward trees give the CTA its **cognitive agency** — a decision-making structure grounded in irreversible consequence and value-driven action.

## 4. Quantum Circuits and Collapse

Quantum computing naturally involves superposition, entanglement, and collapse. However, quantum circuits typically lack an **internal memory of collapse**. CTA fills this gap.

### Integration Concept

1. **Quantum gates** evolve the state into a superposition
2. **Mid-circuit measurements** collapse a qubit
3. The **measurement result** is fed into the CTA, which grows in a new direction
4. The **CTA selects** future quantum operations via conditional logic

### Example Qiskit Pseudocode

```python
# Quantum-CTA integration
qc.h(q[0])
qc.measure(q[0], c[0])

if collapse_result == 0:
    grow_tubule_forward()
else:
    grow_tubule_around()

# CTA determines next gate
if collapse_decision == "spiral":
    qc.h(q[1])
else:
    qc.cx(q[0], q[1])
```

This forms a **feedback loop**:
1. Quantum state evolves
2. Collapse happens
3. CTA grows and records the event
4. CTA selects future gates

A **hybrid system** where NNGs serve perception and CTA serves volition offers a model of artificial consciousness that balances probabilistic learning with irreversible decision-making.

## 6. Conscious Quantum Feedback Loop

CTA and quantum circuits can be merged into a **cyclical agent**:

      description: "New quantum operations applied, continuing the conscious loop",
      components: ["Next quantum gates", "State preparation", "Cycle restart"]
    }
  ]}
/>

This feedback loop is **irreversible, adaptive, and conscious-like**. Every collapse is a commitment; every path, a memory.

### Haskell Implementation

```haskell
-- Quantum-CTA feedback loop
data QuantumCTA = QuantumCTA
  { tubuleGraph :: TubuleGraph
  , quantumState :: QuantumState
  , collapseHistory :: [CollapseEvent]
  } deriving (Show)

-- Main computation loop
quantumCTALoop :: QuantumCTA -> IO QuantumCTA
quantumCTALoop cta = do
  -- Evolve quantum state
  let evolvedState = evolveQuantum (quantumState cta)
  
  -- Perform measurement
  (result, collapsedState) <- measureQuantum evolvedState
  
  -- Feed result to CTA
  let newGraph = growTubule (tubuleGraph cta) result
  
  -- Calculate reward and update
  reward <- evaluateReward newGraph
  let updatedGraph = updateRewards newGraph reward
  
  -- Select next quantum operation
  nextOp <- selectQuantumOperation updatedGraph
  let nextState = applyQuantumOp nextOp collapsedState
  
  return $ QuantumCTA updatedGraph nextState 
    (CollapseEvent result reward : collapseHistory cta)
```

## 9. Conclusion

The Collapse Tubule Automaton offers a **novel model of computation** that merges geometry, decision-making, and consciousness. Integrated with quantum circuits, it becomes a hybrid engine for irreversible, adaptive intelligence. No backpropagation, no reset button — just decisions, consequences, and growth.

**Consciousness may not be a network.**
**It may be a tube collapsing in time.**

*This research is part of the LUCI project, exploring the intersection of quantum mechanics, consciousness, and computation. The Collapse Tubule Automaton represents a step toward building truly conscious machines — not through simulation, but through the direct implementation of the irreversible, choice-making processes that define conscious experience.*
